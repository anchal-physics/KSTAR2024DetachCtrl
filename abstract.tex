We have demonstrated detachment control in KSTAR with the new Tungsten divertor using two different control variables. First variable is the attachment frction calculated from \ac{2PM} using the ion saturation current density from divertor langmuir probes. Second, we used a prototype neural network surrogate model of UEDGE 2D trained on a set of about 70,000 simulations to provide a realtime estimate of heat flux at the outer divertor. We present the successful detachment control results and discuss future improvements in the control infrastructure and control variables for future burning plasma experiments.
