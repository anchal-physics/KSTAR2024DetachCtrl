We have developed a software package for supporting the design and testing of tokamak heat flux and other control systems based on time-dependent physics models. This toolkit condenses the plasma state information from \ac{SOL} simulations such as \ac{SOLPS-ITER} into synthetic diagnostic outputs. We have also developed a realistic model of gas puffing with associated delays and non-linearities. In this paper, we have employed our toolkit to develop a core electron density controller using a synthetic interferometer as the sensor and gas puffing as the actuator. The time-dependent \ac{SOLPS-ITER} simulation to a gas puffing response is measured with the interferometer and a reduced state space model is fitted to the system dynamics. Using this model, we have developed two acausal controller algorithms that can mitigate the detrimental effects of actuation system latency and extended gas injection due to long pipe lengths in gas valves. This toolbox is device agnostic and can be used as plug-and-play with any simulation or physics model that uses \ac{IMAS} data structure. It will be crucial in transferring expertise across devices and helping the controller design and development of various subsystems in fusion devices.
