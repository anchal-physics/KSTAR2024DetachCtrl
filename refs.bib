journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {Rseduction of heat loading appropriate for the plasma facing components such as the divertor is crucial for a fusion reactor. Power handling by large radiative power loss has been studied in long pulse ELMy H-mode discharges on JT-60U (τd = 30–35 s). Case 1 is argon (Ar) seeding into standard ELMy H-mode plasmas, where large radiation loss in the confined region of the main plasma caused a change in ELM characteristics from Type-I to Type-III. Case 2 is a combination of Ar and nitrogen (Ne) gas seeding into Type-I ELMy H-mode plasmas with an internal transport barrier (ITB). For case 1, large radiation loss both from the main plasma and from the divertor was produced, and operation of Type-III ELMs was preferable to a reduction in ELM energy loss fraction (WELM/Wdia) to 0.15%. Both transient and steady-state heat loadings were reduced. Relatively good energy confinement (HH98y2 = 0.87 − 0.75) with large frad (Prad/Pabs &gt; 0.8) and divertor plasma detachment was sustained continuously for 13.5 s. For case 2, with reduced Ar seeding to the main plasma and increased divertor radiation with Ne seeding, the ELMy H-mode plasma with an ITB had better energy confinement (HH98y2 = 0.95 − 0.8), which was sustained continuously for 12 s. The radiated power was increased primarily in the divertor ( ), which was produced both by seeded Ne ions and by carbon influx due to transient (ELM) and steady-state heat loadings in the attached divertor. Reduction in the heat loading was not enough, thus enhancement of the radiated power in the divertor will be necessary for the formation of the divertor detachment.}

abstract = { Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience. }

abstract = {The Alcator C-Mod team has recently developed a feedback system to measure and control surface heat flux in real-time. The system uses real-time measurements of surface heat flux from surface thermocouples and a pulse-width modulated piezo valve to inject low-Z impurities (typically N2) into the private flux region. It has been used in C-Mod to mitigate peak surface heat fluxes  &gt;40 MW m−2 down to  &lt;10 MW m−2 while maintaining excellent core confinement, H98  &gt;  1. While the system works quite well under relatively steady conditions, use of it during transients has revealed important limitations on feedback control of impurity seeding in conventional vertical target plate divertors. In some cases, the system is unable to avoid plasma reattachment to the divertor plate or the formation of a confinement-damaging x-point MARFE. This is due to the small operational window for mitigated heat flux in the parameters of incident plasma heat flux, plasma density, and impurity density as well as the relatively slow response of the impurity gas injection system compared to plasma transients. Given the severe consequences for failure of such a system to operate reliably in a reactor, there is substantial risk that the conventional vertical target plate divertor will not provide an adequately controllable system in reactor-class devices. These considerations motivate the need to develop passively stable, highly compliant divertor configurations and experimental facilities that can test such possible solutions.}

abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {Physics-based simulations project a compact net electric fusion pilot plant with a nuclear testing mission is possible at modest scale based on the advanced tokamak concept, and identify key parameters for its optimization. These utilize a new integrated 1.5D core-edge approach for whole device modeling to predict performance by self-consistently applying transport, pedestal and current drive models to converge fully non-inductive stationary solutions, predicting profiles and energy confinement for a given density. This physics-based approach leads to new insights and understanding of reactor optimization. In particular, the levering role of high plasma density is identified, which raises fusion performance and self-driven ‘bootstrap currents’, to reduce current drive demands and enable high pressure with net electricity at a compact scale. Solutions at 6–7 T, ∼4 m radius and 200 MW net electricity are identified with margins and trade-offs possible between parameters. Current drive comes from neutral beam and ultra-high harmonic (helicon) fast wave, though other advanced approaches are not ruled out. The resulting low recirculating power in a double null configuration leads to a divertor heat flux challenge that is comparable to ITER, though reactor solutions may require more dissipation. Strong H-mode access (x2 margin over L–H transition scalings) and ITER-like heat fluxes are maintained with ∼20%–60% core radiation, though effects on confinement need further analysis. Neutron wall loadings appear tolerable. The approach would benefit from high temperature superconductors, as higher fields would increase performance margins while potential for demountability may facilitate nuclear testing. However, solutions are possible with conventional superconductors. An advanced load sharing and reactive bucking approach in the device centerpost region provides improved mechanical stress handling. The prospect of an affordable test device which could close the loop on net-electric production and conduct essential nuclear materials and breeding research is compelling, motivating research to validate the techniques and models employed here.}

abstract = {The heat flux control of the divertor plate via strike-point splitting generated by biased targets was proposed in the HL-2A tokamak (Cui et al 2021 Fusion Eng. Des. 173 112963). To understand the helical scrape-off layer (SOL) currents driven by hybrid biasing, two SOL current models (model A and B) are employed. Model A is a simplified 2D model that focuses on investigating the effect of biasing on the sheath and elucidating the fundamental physical mechanism of bias-driven SOL current paths. The potential, charge density, electric field and current densities are calculated. Model B takes into account the actual tokamak geometry and computes the resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) generated by bias-driven linear decay currents. Additionally, strike-point splitting is observed in the HL-2A tokamak, indicating that the SOL currents generated by hybrid biasing are capable of generating strong RMPs and consequently influence the magnetic topology. These results confirm the potential of heat/particle flux control by hybrid divertor biased targets.}

abstract={Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak {\`a} Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and `snowflake' configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained `droplets' on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

title = {Controlling marginally detached divertor plasmas},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {A new control system at DIII-D has stabilized the inter-ELM detached divertor plasma state for H-mode in close proximity to the threshold for reattachment, thus demonstrating the ability to maintain detachment with minimal gas puffing. When the same control system was instead ordered to hold the plasma at the threshold (here defined as Te  =  5 eV near the divertor target plate), the resulting Te profiles separated into two groups with one group consistent with marginal detachment, and the other with marginal attachment. The plasma dithers between the attached and detached states when the control system attempts to hold at the threshold. The control system is upgraded from the one described in Kolemen et al (2015 J. Nucl. Mater. 463 1186) and it handles ELMing plasmas by using real time Dα measurements to remove during-ELM slices from real time Te measurements derived from divertor Thomson scattering. The difference between measured and requested inter-ELM Te is passed to a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller to determine gas puff commands. While some degree of detachment is essential for the health of ITER’s divertor, more deeply detached plasmas have greater radiative losses and, at the extreme, confinement degradation, making it desirable to limit detachment to the minimum level needed to protect the target plate (Kolemen et al 2015 J. Nucl. Mater. 463 1186). However, the observed bifurcation in plasma conditions at the outer strike point with the ion B  ×  B drift into the divertor makes this a significant challenge. If the divertor plasma were to reattach between ELMs, there would be a long (depending on delays in the gas puff system) window of high heat flux before detachment could be re-established. Thus, good understanding of detachment behavior near the threshold for re-attachment is required to properly tune an active control system to maintain ideal divertor performance without reattaching. The top-of-pedestal electron densities during dithering across the bifurcation and during stable marginally detached operation are the same within uncertainty, showing the need for local real-time measurements of the divertor conditions.}

A realtime sensor for Prad, div, L has been constructed from 12 foil bolometer channels which agrees with standard post-shot analysis to within 20%. Results with the 12-channel sensor are compared to initial proof-of-concept tests with a single channel as a proxy for Prad, div, L, showing that the upgraded sensor is necessary to overcome limitations of the proxy channel strategy in DIII-D. Using N2 seeding under feedback control, Prad, div, L has been increased by up to 150% above unseeded levels, and a radiated power fraction frad of 80% has been demonstrated, although feedback controlled gas flow is steadier at frad = 55%. Spatial coverage is broad enough to enable Prad control during the strike point sweeps which are commonly used to generate pseudo-2D divertor Thomson measurements in DIII-D divertor experiments. Use of this control reveals challenges that may affect next step devices, which will require actively controlled extrinsic impurity seeding in order to manage heat loads. When operating at high frad, changes in pedestal Te (caused by ELMs in these experiments but could come from other disturbances) resulted in large perturbations to Prad which were destabilizing to the feedback controller.}

Comparing detachment control via Te and Jsat, it appears that Te is the most straightforward sensor to use for accessing detachment onset, while Jsat offers more precise control of degree of detachment. Based on these results, control using nitrogen seeding has so far shown the best ability to follow a target value with the low disruptivity and little to no degradation of performance when an Internal Transport Barrier (ITB) is present, but not all facilities allow its use. Neon seeding also can be paired with feedback control with low impact on core performance as long as there is no disruption, however shots with neon seeding commonly disrupted during these experiments. Argon is effective in EAST, but tends to degrade performance (by ≈10%βp) when detachment is achieved. With ideal conditions and strike point position control, data from a single Langmuir probe are an acceptable input to the control algorithm, but this simple system is easily defeated by strike point displacement comparable to the Te or Jsat scale lengths. The presence of an ITB seems to be critical to retaining core performance in detachment in these parameter ranges, as the pedestal pressure tends to decrease as a result of impurity seeding.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {A multi-machine database for the H-mode scrape-off layer power fall-off length, λq in JET, DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, C-Mod, NSTX and MAST has been assembled under the auspices of the International Tokamak Physics Activity. Regression inside the database finds that the most important scaling parameter is the poloidal magnetic field (or equivalently the plasma current), with λq decreasing linearly with increasing Bpol. For the conventional aspect ratio tokamaks, the regression finds  , yielding λq,ITER ≅ 1 mm for the baseline inductive H-mode burning plasma scenario at Ip = 15 MA. The experimental divertor target heat flux profile data, from which λq is derived, also yield a divertor power spreading factor (S) which, together with λq, allows an integral power decay length on the target to be estimated. There are no differences in the λq scaling obtained from all-metal or carbon dominated machines and the inclusion of spherical tokamaks has no significant influence on the regression parameters. Comparison of the measured λq with the values expected from a recently published heuristic drift based model shows satisfactory agreement for all tokamaks.}

Simultaneously, the core plasma maintains HITER89P of 1.6 and Zeff of 1.4 in this nearly 100\% radiative state.

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Burning plasmas with 500 MW of fusion power on ITER will rely on partially detached divertor operation to keep target heat loads at manageable levels. Such divertor regimes will be maintained by a real-time control system using the seeding of radiative impurities like nitrogen (N), neon or argon as actuator and one or more diagnostic signals as sensors. Recently, real-time control of divertor detachment has been successfully achieved in Type I ELMy H-mode JET-ITER-like wall discharges by using saturation current (Isat) measurements from divertor Langmuir probes as feedback signals to control the level of N seeding. The degree of divertor detachment is calculated in real-time by comparing the outer target peak Isat measurements to the peak Isat value at the roll-over in order to control the opening of the N injection valve. Real-time control of detachment has been achieved in both fixed and swept strike point experiments. The system has been progressively improved and can now automatically drive the divertor conditions from attached through high recycling and roll-over down to a user-defined level of detachment. Such a demonstration is a successful proof of principle in the context of future operation on ITER which will be extensively equipped with divertor target probes.}

title = {Tokamak divertor plasma emulation with machine learning},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {Future tokamak devices that aim to create conditions relevant to power plant operations must consider strategies for mitigating damage to plasma facing components in the divertor. One of the goals of MAST-U tokamak operations is to inform these considerations by researching advanced divertor configurations that aid stable plasma detachment. Machine design, scenario planning and detachment control would all greatly benefit from tools that enable rapid calculation of scenario-relevant quantities given some input parameters. This paper presents a method for generating large, simulated scrape-off layer data sets, which was applied to generate a data set of steady-state Hermes-3 simulations of the MAST-U tokamak. A machine learning model was constructed using a Bayesian approach to hyperparameter optimisation to predict diagnosable output quantities given control-relevant input features. The resulting best-performing model, which is based on a feedforward neural network, achieves high accuracy when predicting electron temperature at the divertor target and carbon impurity radiation front position and runs in around 1 ms in inference mode. Techniques for interpreting the predictions made by the model were applied, and a high-resolution parameter scan of upstream conditions was performed to demonstrate the utility of rapidly generating accurate predictions using the emulator. This work represents a step forward in the design of machine learning-driven emulators of tokamak exhaust simulation codes in operational modes relevant to divertor detachment control and plasma scenario design.}

The developed neural networks fully reconstruct not only the poloidal flux function  but also the toroidal current density function  with the off-line EFIT quality.

A series of gas actuation sequences are input into SOLPS-ITER to produce a dynamic response in upstream and divertor plasma quantities. The SINDy method is applied to identify reduced linear and nonlinear models for the electron density at the outboard midplane  and the electron temperature at the outer divertor . Note that  is not necessarily the peak value of T  e  along the divertor. The identified reduced models are interpretable by construction (i.e. not black box), and have the form of coupled ordinary differential equations. Despite significant noise in , the reduced models can be used to predict the response over a range of actuation levels to a maximum deviation of 0.5% in  and 5%–10% in  for the cases considered. Model retraining using time history data triggered by a preset error threshold is also demonstrated. A model predictive control strategy for nonlinear models is developed and used to perform feedback control of a SOLPS-ITER simulation to produce a setpoint trajectory in  using the integrated plasma simulator framework. The developed techniques are general and can be applied to time-dependent data from other boundary simulations or experimental data. Ongoing work is extending the approach to model identification and control for divertor detachment, which will present transient nonlinear behavior from impurity seeding, including realistic latency and synthetic diagnostic signals derived from the full SOLPS-ITER output.}

	abstract={The predicted divertor conditions for the SPARC tokamak are calculated using SOLPS-ITER for a range of scrape-off-layer (SOL) heat flux widths $\lamq$, input powers, and particle fuelling locations. Under H-mode scenario conditions with an upstream separatrix density of 1\e20 m$^{-3}$, the most conservative range of $\lamq$ extrapolations ($\approx$ 0.15 mm) results in extremely high unmitigated particle and energy fluxes to the divertor, both under full field (12.2 T) and power ($P_{SOL}$ = 29 MW) conditions, and 2/3 field with $P_{SOL}$ = 10 MW. Increasing the cross-field SOL diffusivities by 2-10x reduces the magnitude of the mitigation challenge, however strategies such as impurity seeding or strike-point-sweeping will likely still be required. &#xD;&#xD;A combination of steady-state and time-dependent SOLPS-ITER simulations are used to map out phase space diagrams of upstream and divertor conditions. At low upstream density the inner and outer divertor conditions are highly asymmetric, with a large temperature difference and significant heat fluxes driven by parallel currents. The solution has sharp bifurcations with a region of hysteresis, depending on whether the initial state is at a low or high density. This behavior is observed even when the fuelling location, cross-field diffusivity, and impurity level is changed, although the density window with asymmetry is reduced.&#xD;&#xD;The addition of neon impurity seeding reduces the divertor heat fluxes, but also causes a drop in the upstream electron density with fixed particle throughput. This drop can be counteracted by increased main ion throughput, however too much neon results in a back transition into the asymmetric divertor regimes suggesting a need for control of both main ion and impurity seeding levels to achieve a desired divertor state.}

Compared with earlier unswept feedforward counterparts, similar strong mitigation of divertor heat load between ELMs was achieved in swept RTC cases for less than half the integrated nitrogen input and correspondingly less adverse effect upon other properties. Both sweeping and RT control contributed to this improvement. Time-average normalized energy confinement ⟨H98y⟩t ∼ 1, Greenwald density fraction ⟨fGwd⟩t ∼ 0.9 and particularly purity denoted by effective ionic charge ⟨Zeff⟩t ≈ 1.7, all remained closer to good reference levels.

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {This paper presents the application of full time-dependent SOLPS-ITER simulations for actuator design in the SPARC tokamak. This study employs both the EIRENE module, a neutral solver, and the B2.5 plasma module in a time-dependent mode. This is in contrast to most SOLPS simulations, which focus on steady-state solutions, where the neutral distribution is evolved without any time limit or for a time step of 1 second, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the fluid plasma time step. The time-dependent EIRENE was tested with a fixed B2.5 background and compared with a simple conductance based model in a simplified pump chamber geometry. This comparison aimed to verify the reliability of the neutral relaxation timescale derived from the time-dependent EIRENE. Subsequently, a full time-dependent simulation was performed in a realistic geometry, with the Monte-Carlo neutral time step synchronized with the plasma fluid time step. The numerical setup of the code, including relative time steps and the size of the census data used to store Monte-Carlo particle information is considered. The full-time dependent simulations are then applied to inform the design of the SPARC louver structure, which affects divertor plasma parameters by regulating the neutral conductance from the divertor to the pump. The response of the plasma and neutral parameters was captured on a timescale that enables the design of the actuator to consider time-dependent control capability. It was found that changing the louver opacity has an equivalent effect as varying the gas throughput via puff actuation. Therefore, equivalent divertor plasma conditions can be obtained from both actuators, while the neutral pressure distribution in the pump and divertor differs for each actuator.}

abstract = {On the eve of component procurement, this paper discusses the present physics basis for the first ITER tungsten (W) divertor, beginning with a reminder of the key elements defining the overall design, and outlining relevant aspects of the Research Plan accompanying the new “staged approach” to ITER nuclear operations which fixes the overall divertor lifetime constraint. The principal focus is on the main design driver, steady state power fluxes in the DT phases, obtained from simulations using the 2-D SOLPS-4.3 and SOLPS-ITER plasma boundary codes, assuming the use of the low Z seeding impurities nitrogen (N) and neon (Ne). A new perspective on the simulation database is adopted, concentrating purely on the divertor physics aspects rather than on the core-edge integration, which has been studied extensively in the course of the divertor design evolution and is published elsewhere. Emphasis is placed on factors which may increase the peak steady state loads: divertor target shaping for component misalignment protection, the influence of fluid drifts, and the consequences of narrow scrape-off layer heat flux channels. All tend to push the divertor into an operating space at higher sub-divertor neutral pressure in order to remain at power flux densities acceptable for the target material. However, a revised criterion for the maximum tolerable loads based on avoidance of W recrystallization, sets an upper limit potentially ∼50% higher than the previously accepted value of ∼10 MW m−2, a consequence both of the choice of material and the finalized component design. Although the simulation database is currently restricted to the 2-D toroidally symmetric situation, considerable progress is now also being made using the EMC3-Eirene 3-D code suite for the assessment of power loading in the presence of magnetic perturbations for ELM control. Some new results for low input power corresponding to the early H-mode operation phases are reported, showing that even if realistic plasma screening is taken into account, significant asymmetric divertor heat fluxes may arise far from the unperturbed strike point. The issue of tolerable limits for transient heat pulses is an open and key question. A new scaling for ELM power deposition has shown that whilst there may be more latitude for operation at higher current without ELM control, the ultimate limit is likely to be set more by material fatigue under large numbers of sub-threshold melting events.}

title = {Fast dynamic 1D simulation of divertor plasmas with neural PDE surrogates},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {Managing divertor plasmas is crucial for operating reactor scale tokamak devices due to heat and particle flux constraints on the divertor target. Simulation is an important tool to understand and control these plasmas, however, for real-time applications or exhaustive parameter scans only simple approximations are currently fast enough. We address this lack of fast simulators using neural partial differential equation (PDE) surrogates, data-driven neural network-based surrogate models trained using solutions generated with a classical numerical method. The surrogate approximates a time-stepping operator that evolves the full spatial solution of a reference physics-based model over time. We use DIV1D, a 1D dynamic model of the divertor plasma, as reference model to generate data. DIV1D’s domain covers a 1D heat flux tube from the X-point (upstream) to the target. We simulate a realistic TCV divertor plasma with dynamics induced by upstream density ramps and provide an exploratory outlook towards fast transients. State-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates are evaluated in a common framework and extended for properties of the DIV1D data. We evaluate (1) the speed-accuracy trade-off; (2) recreating non-linear behavior; (3) data efficiency; and (4) parameter inter- and extrapolation. Once trained, neural PDE surrogates can faithfully approximate DIV1D’s divertor plasma dynamics at sub real-time computation speeds: In the proposed configuration,  ms of plasma dynamics can be computed in  ms of wall-clock time, several orders of magnitude faster than DIV1D.}

abstract = {A two-dimensional calculation is presented for the transport of plasma in the edge region of a divertor tokamak solving continuity, momentum, and energy balance fluid equations. The model uses classical processes of parallel transport along the magnetic field and cross-field drifts together with anomalous radial diffusion, including perpendicular ion viscosity. The self-consistent electrostatic potential is calculated on both sides of the magnetic separatrix via quasineutrality and current continuity. Outside the separatrix, the model extends to material divertor plates where the incident plasma is recycled as neutral gas and where the plate sheath and parallel currents dominate the potential structure. Inside the separatrix, various radial current terms—from anomalous viscosity, collisional damping, inertia, and ∇B drifts—contribute to determining the potential. The model rigorously enforces cancellation of gyroviscous and magnetization terms from the transport equations. The results emphasize the importance of E×B particle flow under the X-point which depends on the sign of the toroidal magnetic field. Radial electric field profiles at the outer midplane show strong variation with the magnitude of the anomalous diffusion coefficients and the core toroidal rotation velocity, indicating that shear stabilization of edge turbulence can likewise be sensitive to these parameters. },

In the ST plasmas of line averaged electron density &lt; &gt; ∼0.7–1 × 1018 m−3, about 20%–40% of the current  driven by ∼85 V sawtooth bias voltage reaches the lower divertor plate along the biased scrape-off-layer (SOL) flux tube as the SOL current . The fact  is noticeably lower than  indicates an appreciable leakage of parallel current from the biased SOL flux tube. The leakage currents in the toroidal and radial directions are confirmed by detection of them using the unbiased plates in the TDDB experiments. From the ion saturation current density profile obtained by a divertor Langmuir probe array, the fall-off lengths of divertor particle flux are estimated together with the strike line position. Total particle flux to the upper divertor, evaluated by the integrated ion saturation current density profile is reduced by up to 45% during positive biasing of the TDDB, depending on the position of the strike line to the biased plate. In addition, the TDDB also induces a noticeable loss of fast electrons produced by ECCD, leading to an ∼2% reduction in the maximum toroidal current of the ST plasma compared to a shot without the TDDB. Reduction of the divertor particle flux and enhancement of the fast electron losses are thought to be dominantly caused by E  drift induced by the TDDB. In the present experimental conditions, the effects of magnetic perturbations produced by the SOL currents on the fast electron losses can be neglected because of a too small SOL current.}

abstract = {The active feedback control of radiated power to prevent divertor target plates overheating during long-pulse operation has been developed and implemented on EAST. The radiation control algorithm, with impurity seeding via a supersonic molecular beam injection (SMBI) system, has shown great success in both reliability and stability. By seeding a sequence of short neon (Ne) impurity pulses with the SMBI from the outer mid-plane, the radiated power of the bulk plasma can be well controlled, and the duration of radiative control (feedforward and feedback) is 4.5 s during a discharge of 10 s. Reliable control of the total radiated power of bulk plasma has been successfully achieved in long-pulse upper single null (USN) discharges with a tungsten divertor. The achieved control range of  is 20%–30% in L-mode regimes and 18%–36% in H-mode regimes. The temperature of the divertor target plates was maintained at a low level during the radiative control phase. The peak particle flux on the divertor target was decreased by feedforward Ne injection in the L-mode discharges, while the Ne pulses from the SMBI had no influence on the peak particle flux because of the very small injecting volume. It is shown that although the radiated power increased, no serious reduction of plasma-stored energy or confinement was observed during the control phase. The success of the radiation control algorithm and current experiments in radiated power control represents a significant advance for steady-state divertor radiation and heat flux control on EAST for near-future long-pulse operation.}

The control algorithm controlled the degree of detachment effectively during the 2018 EAST experiments through either D2 fueling in the low field side using SMBI or impurity seeding from the divertor volume in H-mode plasmas, without significant degradation of the core-plasma performance, i.e., exhibiting good core-edge-divertor integration. The algorithm implementation in PCS and experimental results will be reported in this paper. Further efforts will be made to extend active feedback control towards long-pulse H-mode detachment maintenance in the near future, which will benefit the high power, H-mode operation for ITER.}

abstract={We present a fast and accurate data-driven surrogate model for divertor plasma detachment prediction leveraging the latent feature space concept in machine learning research. Our approach involves constructing and training two neural networks: an autoencoder that finds a proper latent space representation (LSR) of plasma state by compressing the multi-modal diagnostic measurements and a forward model using multi-layer perception (MLP) that projects a set of plasma control parameters to its corresponding LSR. By combining the forward model and the decoder network from autoencoder, this new data-driven surrogate model is able to predict a consistent set of diagnostic measurements based on a few plasma control parameters. In order to ensure that the crucial detachment physics is correctly captured, highly efficient 1D UEDGE model is used to generate training and validation data in this study. The benchmark between the data-driven surrogate model and UEDGE simulations shows that our surrogate model is capable of providing accurate detachment prediction (usually within a few per cent relative error margin) but with at least four orders of magnitude speed-up, indicating that performance-wise, it has the potential to facilitate integrated tokamak design and plasma control. Comparing with the widely used two-point model and/or two-point model formatting, the new data-driven model features additional detachment front prediction and can be easily extended to incorporate richer physics. This study demonstrates that the complicated divertor and scrape-off-layer plasma state has a low-dimensional representation in latent space. Understanding plasma dynamics in latent space and utilising this knowledge could open a new path for plasma control in magnetic fusion energy research.}
