KSTAR \#36161 DivControlNN quantities.
(a) Shows the calculated heat flux at outer divertor calculated by DivControlNN.
Rest of the panels are inputs to DivControlNN.
(b) Shows the line averaged electron density.
(c) Shows the plasma current.
(d) Shows the total injected power.
(e) Shows the impurity fraction estimate.
Note that this calculation malfunctioned and fed constant zero input to the model even though N$_2$ was puffed in this shot.
Apart from these inputs, diffusion scaling factor was set to a constant value of 1.0 in the model.
