 \caption{
Detachment control shot \#35857 using \Afrac controller.
(a) Shows the measured ion saturation current by realtime Langmuir Probe array at locations marked by grey dashed lines.
The data has been interpolated spatially using cubic spline interpolation.
The black curve shows the post-shot calculated strike point position on outer divertor using EFIT.
(b) Shows the \Afrac calculated from peak value among the Langmuir probe array.
The dashed black line shows the target provided to the controller to follow.
(c) Left axis: Shows the N$_2$ gas command steps sent for system identification.
Right axis: Shows the cummulative N$_2$ gas particles injected into the vessel.
(d) Total radiated power measured by \ac{IRVB}.
(e) Left axis: Shows $\beta_n$.
Right axis: Shows the plasma current (I$_p$).
