 \caption{System identification shot \#35853.
(a) Shows the measured ion saturation current by realtime \ac{LP} array at locations marked by grey dashed lines.
The data has been interpolated spatially using cubic spline interpolation.
The black curve shows the post-shot calculated strike point position on outer divertor using EFIT.
(b) Shows the \Afrac calculated from peak value among the \ac{LP} array.
The dashed black line shows the system identification fit on this data.
(c) Left axis: Shows the N$_2$ gas command steps sent for system identification.
Right axis: Shows the cummulative N$_2$ gas particles injected into the vessel.
(d) Left axis: Shows $\beta_n$.
Right axis: Shows the plasma current (I$_p$).
$^*$ Note: \Afrac for this shot was not calibrated properly and the raw data reported 2 times the value.
We fixed this factor after this shot and this figure shows the corrected value.
