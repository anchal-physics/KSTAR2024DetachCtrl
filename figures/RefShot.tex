Reference shot \#35851.
(a) Showing last closed flux surface at t=8 seconds.
The magnetic shape control was programmed to keep X point fixed which provided a sufficiently stable strike point on the realtime Langmuir Probe array.
(b) Zoomed-in locations of realtime Outer Divertor (OD) Langmuir probes.
(c) Plasma current (I$_p$) and $\beta_n$ for reference shot.
