Strike point width estimation for reference shot \# 35851.
the raw data from langmuir probe array has been filtered by 8th order Butterworth filter ith cut-off frequency of 20 Hz and then down sampled to 40 Hz.
For each data point on this plot, the x-axis position is calculated by subtracting the \ac{OSP} position reported by EFIT from the probe's Z coordinate.
