 \caption{
Detachment control shot \#36161 using DivControlNN heat flux at outer divertor.
(a) Shows the measured ion saturation current by realtime \ac{LP} array at locations marked by grey dashed lines.
The data has been interpolated spatially using cubic spline interpolation.
The black curve shows the post-shot calculated strike point position on outer divertor using EFIT.
(b) Shows the heat flux at outer divertor calculated by DivControlNN.
The dashed black line shows the target provided to the controller to follow.
(c) Left axis: Shows the N$_2$ gas command steps sent for system identification.
Right axis: Shows the cummulative N$_2$ gas particles injected into the vessel.
(d) Left axis: Shows the \Afrac calculated from peak value among the \ac{LP} array.
Right axis: Total radiated power measured by \ac{IRVB}.
(e) Left axis: Shows $\beta_n$.
Right axis: Shows the plasma current (I$_p$).
