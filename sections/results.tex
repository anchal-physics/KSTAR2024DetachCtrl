Utilizing the controllers tuned in Sec.\ref{sec:sysid}, we attempted detachment control experiments.
First, we used \Afrac controller in KSTAR \#35857 with results shown in Fig.\ref{fig:detctrl_afrac}.
As can be seen in Fig.\ref{fig:detctrl_afrac}a, the strike point remained within 12.5~mm of one of the probes of the realtime Langmuir probe array, thus the obtained \Afrac signal shown in Fig.\ref{fig:detctrl_afrac}b has error $\lesssim$13\%.
% \textcolor{red}{Whether or not you actually change the text, I think it's important to think of this in terms of an upper bound on measurement error due to strike point drift. Since this value can change, even subtle drifts can create artifacts in the signal. If you think of it as just valid/invalid, you can miss this.}
Here, we can see that the controller was successful in closely following the target provided to it completing the pre-programmed shot length to the end.
It is also evident that the aggressive control strategy was good and did not result in any long sustained oscillations while providing a quick response to the changing target value.
% \textcolor{red}{I think it's too aggressive and you should tone down how good you say it is. I don't like that it fully turns the gas off. I would like it better if it gave an opening blip to push Afrac down, then settled to a maintenance level. Instead, it's delivering the maintenance level as a series of bumps at 12 and 15~s: an oscillation instead of something steady. The oscillation doesn't appear to be growing, but you only saw like 1.5 periods of the thing so who knows. A controller that gives a fluctuating command when a steady one would do might drive some other oscillation or instability in this intensely complicated, inter-connected system. This could be more like "got away with it" than "good". And for one shot set against the drastic changes in environment, I'll take "got away with it"! That's a pretty big achievement. But next time should be better, and better should include less aggressive tuning.}
From 8s to 10s, it can be seen that the injected N$_2$ was just enough to ramp down the measured \Afrac with the same slope.
The accumulated offset from the target eventually caused the integral term to send a brief impulse of nitrogen near 9.8~s and then the controller further converged with the target value.
% \textcolor{red}{Are you sure? There is a bump up in Afrac that looks like it should drive a blip in the proportional term that could be enough to explain the final peak in command.}
% This has been verified, see ../figures/PID_breakout_35857.pdf
For the rest of the shot, small nitrogen puffs were required to correct the drifting \Afrac and keep it on the target.
The total radiated power from the plasma as measured by KSTAR \ac{IRVB} remained below 3.5 MW ($\approx$65\% of injected power) and as can be seen in Fig.\ref{fig:prad_2d}a (snapshot taken at around the time of maximum radiation), the majority of the radiation was coming from the divertor region and the core region was not loosing power through radiation.
% \textcolor{red}{Double check IRVB in case they updated data again.} Double checked, we are not affected by the changes.
% \textcolor{red}{Quote radiation fraction $f_{rad}=P_{rad}/P_{input}$ in addition to Prad in MW.}
This further validated, that \Afrac controller strategy first devised in Ref.\cite{Eldon_2022_PPCF} is a viable option for detachment control even with Tungsten divertor in KSTAR.

Since \Afrac controller has been demonstrated in the past as well, we decided to utilize the remaining allotted runtime on KSTAR to test the DivControlNN prototype-based controller.
Fig.\ref{fig:detctrl_sm} shows the results from shot \#36161 where we deployed this controller.
An immediate issue was seen with DivControlNN output that the initial heat flux calculation had a different starting value than what we saw in reference shots and system identification shot \#35854.
Because of this, when the controller turned on at 7.5s, the large error resulted in the railing of gas command output which caused too much N$_2$ injected into the system.
While this quickly brought down the measured signal, it also resulted in an overshoot.
In the next ramp-down of the target from 10.5s to 11.5s, more impurity was injected as we tuned an aggressive controller.
It can be seen from \Afrac in Fig.\ref{fig:detctrl_sm}d that the system reached deep detachment by this point and the ion saturation current measurements (Fig.\ref{fig:detctrl_sm}a) became unreliable beyond 12~s.
% \textcolor{red}{Why unreliable after 11~s? The strike point position looks close enough until perhaps 12 or slightly after.}
In post-analysis of IRVB inverted data as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:prad_2d}, we can see that the core started radiating a lot of power after the last railed impulse of gas input between 10.8~s to 12~s.
This would have reduced $P_{SOL}$ and started to starve the divertor of power, driving or contributing to the failure to follow the rising heat flux target shown in Fig.\ref{fig:detctrl_sm}b between 13 and 15~s.
% \textcolor{red}{Comment on hysteresis stemming from interaction between core and impurity seeding for divertor management? I'll write something if I can find the right words.}
There is no surprise with the fact that setting target values for an uncalibrated output is not always deterministic and would cause issues as we faced.

Post-shot data analysis discovered further issues in our operation of the DivControlNN model.
The impurity fraction calculation as mentioned in \ref{sec:control_variables} malfunctioned and sent a constant zero input to the model (see Fig.\ref{fig:SM_inputs_35857}e).
Thus the model was unable to respond to large amounts of impurity that were injected into the system and was only relying on data from line-integrated core electron density and plasma current as realtime inputs.
% \textcolor{red}{As mentioned earlier, I think this should be brought up during the setup section so that we describe what we actually set up, not just what we intended to set up.}
In the past it has been seen that deuterium alone is sufficient to attain partial detachment\cite{Loarte_1998_NF, Eldon_2017_NF}.
\textcolor{red}{No, not deuterium alone. Deuterium \emph{puffing} alone can do it, if there's a carbon wall to sputter to make a carbon source to go with the deuterium puff. KSTAR still has a carbon main wall that could do it. Also, $P_{rad}=n_e n_Z L_Z(T_e)$, so changing $n_e$ when you have some background impurity will do it. So yes, puffing deuterium in the presence of some fixed impurity population will drive detachment, even if the D2 doesn't trigger any additional sputtering related impurity influx. The ELMs will have knocked carbon off the main chamber wall. Then increasing deuterium density in the divertor will increase $n_e$ and therefore $P_{rad}$. Be precise about these things. The results you quoted were from carbon-walled devices. Not for this paper per se but for fun, check ASDEX Upgrade results to see if detachment can be achieved with D2 only puffing in full tungsten.}
This might be the case with shot \#36161, that the model inference with zero impurity fraction input still reported a decrease in estimated heatflux as the electron density input increased with N$_2$ puffing.
% \textcolor{red}{Did they put background carbon in? Although the seeded impurity (neon I think in that version of DivControlNN) may have been 0, the intrinsic impurity might not have been.} No there was no intrinsic impurity in the sims
The only other changeable input, input power, mostly remained constant during flat top of the shot.
However, as the amount of total puffed N$_2$ increased, the pure deuterium plasma case from which the model must be infering the heat flux would deviate and thus the control is not very good beyond 11s.
\textcolor{red}{I don't think this logic holds up. The control variable might not correlate well with reality if changes in impurity fraction become too large, but if it still responds similarly to the control actuator, that shouldn't be a barrier to control. It's not clear that you can blame deficiencies in control performance on this.}
Despite these limitations, this preliminary test sheds light on the potential of using such a surrogate model-based controller for detachment control in future reactors.
